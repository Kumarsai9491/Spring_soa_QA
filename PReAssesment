 1. Create a field on Account named "Number of Contacts". Populate this field with the number of contacts related to an account.

For this we can were going to write triger, because contact is not necessary to have an account to choose for roll up summary functionality.

step 1: Create an number field in account object with label  as Number of Contacts and APi name is Number_of_Contacts__c.
Step 2: Use an existing trigger on contact if is present or create new trigger on contact.
Step 3: Write our logic in trigger handler which will be called in after update and after insert of contact record.
Step 4 : updat the Number of Contacts value based on records availability under that account.

Writing trigger on contact(assuming custom trigger is not present)
trigger ContactTrigger on Contact(after insert, after update){
  if(trigger.isAfter){
      if(trigger.isUpdate){
          contactTriggerHandler.afterUpdate(trigger.oldMap.values(),trigger.newMap.values());
      }
      if(trigger.isInsert){
          contactTriggerHandler.afterInsert(Trigger.newMap.values());
      }
  }
}

 3. Make a basic http callout and print the result using system.debug
